## About Me

I'm a **Machine Learning Infrastructure Engineer** and **Quantitative Finance practitioner** specializing in building production-grade AI systems for financial markets. Currently completing my **MS in Computer Science** and **Certificate in Quantitative Finance (CQF)**.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- 🤖 **AI/ML Systems**: Building autonomous trading agents, distributed ML platforms, and high-performance inference engines
- 📊 **Quantitative Finance**: Derivatives pricing, statistical arbitrage, risk management, and algorithmic trading
- ⚡ **Infrastructure**: Distributed systems, HPC, real-time data processing at scale

**Current Focus**: Deploying autonomous trading systems that combine LLM reasoning with quantitative models for production trading environments.
